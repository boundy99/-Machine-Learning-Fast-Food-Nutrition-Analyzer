# Fast Food Nutrition Analyzer

## Project Overview

The Fast Food Nutrition Analyzer is an interactive data application designed to provide detailed and predictive nutritional information about fast food items. This application utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze extensive nutritional data, helping users make informed dietary choices.

## Features

- Interactive analysis of fast food nutritional content including calories, fats, proteins, and carbohydrates.
- Predictive modeling to estimate nutritional content using linear regression.
- Visualization of actual versus predicted nutritional values to enhance user understanding.

## How to Run the Project

Follow these step-by-step instructions to get the application running:

1. **Open Google Colab**:
   - Access [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) by clicking the link and sign in with a Google account if prompted.

2. **Load the Project Notebook**:
   - Open the [Fast Food Nutrition Analyzer Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BvOsymQMx_KTYL3cFjkVsMfbAOo1f0iR) directly in your browser.

3. **Clone the GitHub Repository**:
   - Run the following command in the first code cell of the Colab notebook to clone the project repository:
     ```
     !git clone https://github.com/boundy99/Capstone
     ```

4. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Execute each cell in the notebook by clicking the "Play" button or pressing `Shift + Enter`. It's crucial to run the cells in the order they appear to avoid execution errors.

5. **Interact with the Application**:
   - As you proceed, interact with the visualizations and modify parameters to test different scenarios. The notebook provides a dynamic way to explore the impact of various nutritional factors on health.
